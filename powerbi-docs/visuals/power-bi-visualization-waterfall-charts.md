# Waterfall charts in Power BI

Waterfall charts show a running total as Power BI adds and subtracts values. They're useful for understanding how an initial value (like net income) is affected by a series of positive and negative changes.

The columns are color coded so you can quickly notice increases and decreases. The initial and the final value columns often [start on the horizontal axis](https://support.office.com/article/Create-a-waterfall-chart-in-Office-2016-for-Windows-8de1ece4-ff21-4d37-acd7-546f5527f185#BKMK_Float "start on the horizontal axis"), while the intermediate values are floating columns. Because of this style, waterfall charts are also called bridge charts.

## When to use a waterfall chart

Waterfall charts are a great choice:

* When you have changes for the measure across time, a series, or different categories.

* To audit the major changes contributing to the total value.

* To plot your company's annual profit by showing various sources of revenue and arrive at the total profit (or loss).

* To illustrate the beginning and the ending headcount for your company in a year.

* To visualize how much money you make and spend each month, and the running balance for your account.

## Prerequisites

* The Power BI service or Power BI Desktop

* Retail Analysis Sample report

## Get the Retail Analysis Sample report

These instructions use the Retail Analysis Sample. Creating a visualization requires edit permissions to the dataset and report. Luckily, the Power BI samples are all editable. If someone shares a report with you, you can't create visualizations in reports. To follow along, get the [Retail Analysis Sample report](../sample-datasets.md).

After you get the **Retail Analysis Sample** dataset, you can get started.

## Create a waterfall chart

You'll create a waterfall chart that displays sales variance (estimated sales versus actual sales) by month.

1. From **My Workspace**, select **Datasets** > **Create a report**.

    ![Screenshot of Datasets > Create a report.](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-create-a-report.png)

1. From the **Fields** pane, select **Sales** > **Total Sales Variance**.

   ![Screenshot of Sales > Total Sales Varience selected and the visual that results.](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-first-value.png)

1. Select the waterfall icon ![Screenshot of the waterfall icon](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall-icon.png) to convert the chart to a treemap.

    If **Total Sales Variance** isn't in the **Y-Axis** area, drag it there.

    ![Visualization templates](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/convertwaterfall.png)

1. Select **Time** > **FiscalMonth** to add it to the **Category** well.

    ![waterfall](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall.png)

1. Make sure Power BI sorted the waterfall chart chronologically. From the top-right corner of the chart, select the ellipsis (...).

    Check that there is a yellow indicator next to the left of the **Sort ascending** and **FiscalMonth** options

    ![Select sort by > FiscalMonth](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-sort-by.png)

    You can also look at the X-Axis values and see that they are in order from **Jan** to **Aug**.

    Dig in a little more to see what's contributing most to the changes month to month.

1. Drag **Store** > **Territory** to the **Breakdown** bucket.

    ![Shows Store in Breakdown bucket](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall-breakdown.png)

    By default, Power BI adds the top five contributors to increases or decreases by month.

    ![Shows Store in Breakdown bucket](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall-breakdown-initial.png)

    You're only interested in the top two contributors.

1. In the **Format** pane, select **Breakdown** and set **Max breakdowns** to **2**.

    ![Format > Breakdown](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall-breakdown-maximum.png)

    A quick review reveals that the territories of Ohio and Pennsylvania are the biggest contributors to movement, both negative and positive, in your waterfall chart.

    ![waterfall chart](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-waterfall-axis.png)

    It's an interesting finding. Do Ohio and Pennsylvania have such a significant impact because sales in these two territories are much higher than the other territories? You can check that.

1. Create a map that looks at this year sales value and last year sales by territory.

    ![map close-up on PA and Ohio](media/power-bi-visualization-waterfall-charts/power-bi-map.png)

    The map supports your theory. It shows that these two territories had the highest value of sales last year (bubble size) and this year (bubble shading).

## Highlighting and cross-filtering

For information about using the **Filters** pane, see [Add a filter to a report in Editing view](../power-bi-report-add-filter.md).

Highlighting a column in a waterfall chart cross-filters the other visualizations on the report page and the other way around. However, the **Total** column doesn't trigger highlighting or respond to cross-filtering.
